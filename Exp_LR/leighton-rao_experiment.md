## Leighton-Rao Experiment

For small graphs up to size 500, we'll run experiments both on Skyline and my laptop, since I have a feeling my laptop will be almost as fast as skyline.

I want to report: nodes, edges, number of constraints, tolerance satisfied, final gap, final objective, runtime, approximation ratio.

Smaller networks to run on both machines, with gamma = 5.0, and lambda = 1/n.

* Dolphins
* Les Mis
* Adjnoun
* polbooks
* football
* jazz
* celegansneural
* netsience
* celegansmetabolic

Then one by one, we run larger graphs, with gamma = 5 and lambda = 1/n again?

If that doesn't go great, try other things.
